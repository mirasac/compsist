## Introduction
Repository for notebooks and code of the course of [Complexity in social systems](https://fisica-sc.campusnet.unito.it/do/corsi.pl/Show?_id=4ef1), taken during the first semester of the academic year 2022-2023 for the master's degree in Physics of Complex Systems at UniTo.

The regular teachers of this course are Professor Giovanni Petri and Professor Maxime Lucas. Slides are stored on the Moodle site of the course and notebooks and information are present on [the course site](https://lordgrilo.github.io/complexity-book/intro.html).

Each lesson is split in two halves: first a teoric part, then a practil part on Jupyter notebooks.

### Disclaimer
This repository exists just as an effective way to save the code while the exercises are being done, it is not meant for presenting them in a complete and nice way. Just the information sufficient for the course are included.

## Repository structure
Files and exercises used in each lesson are contained in folders named with the day of the relative lesson in [ISO format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Dates) for calendar dates, with dashes.

## Setup
I do exercises on Google Colab.
